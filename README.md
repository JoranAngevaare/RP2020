# How to get started?
  - Download ZIP (by clicking green 'Clone or download' button and selecting) and unzip (alternatively do a git clone <https://github.com/jorana/RP2020.git> if you are familiar with git).
  - We assume you have python 3 installed, preferably in an [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) environment. As a bare minimum you'll have to have jupyter installed.
  - After that you can get started! As the name suggests **``00_getting_started``** is the place to be. There you'll find a notebook with essential information on how to get started (aptly called **`0. before_you_get_started`**). **Don't miss**:
    - the instruction video; and 
    - paper cited in that notebook!
  - From thereon you can continue with the other notebooks that are numbered and we advice you to go through in ascending order.

# Help I'm stuck; how to ask questions?
Normally we'd be around for you to ask questions, but this is unfortunately not possible. This however shouldn't be a threshold for you to ask questions if you are stuck. You can either email the supervises as detailed above or reach out for Joran on gitter (https://gitter.im, search for User JoranA). We can also organize a zoom session whenever needed.
